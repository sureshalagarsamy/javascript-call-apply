### What is the difference between call and apply?

> CALL

Call a function with the <b>specified arguments</b>. You can use call, if you know how many argument are going to pass to the functions.

>APPLY

Call a function with <b>argument provided as an array</b>. You can use apply if you don't know how many argument are going to pass to the functions.

Both (call and apply) are using to call a functions.

Here is an advantage over apply and call. The .call() method is little bit faster than .apply() method.
